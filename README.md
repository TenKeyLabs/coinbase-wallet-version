# Coinbase Wallet Version CLI

`cwv` is a tool to download or bundle versions of the [Coinbase Wallet Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coinbase-wallet-extension/hnfanknocfeofbddgcijnmhnfnkdnaad?hl=en).

## Why

Mostly made this for fun and I hope a most official distribution channel for this extension is exposed to the community. Until then, this is will be used to power the [coinbase wallet versions](https://github.com/osis/coinbase-wallet-versions) archive.
